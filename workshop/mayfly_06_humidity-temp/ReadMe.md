Workshop Sketch 6: Humidity & Temperature
==============

Connect the Grove Digital Temp/Humidity board to D10-11 Grove connector on the Mayfly.

###Basic code elements, Lesson 2:

* Include Library
  * `#include` is used to include outside libraries in your sketch. This gives the programmer access to a large group of standard C libraries (groups of pre-made functions), and also libraries written especially for Arduino.
  * More information is availble at [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Include](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Include)
* Sensor documentation
  * It is ofen helpful to find and read documenation for sensors or periferal devices. For this Grove Digital Temp/Humidity ensor board, see [http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-TemperatureAndHumidity_Sensor/](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-TemperatureAndHumidity_Sensor/)
